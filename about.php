My name is  Jesse Matty I'm a full stack web developer / java developer looking to land his first job.
Born In Toledo, Ohio  and now live in  Northwest,  Florida.
I'm self taught in Java, JavaFX,  Java Script, HTML CSS, Node.js  MYSQL PHP, Apache, and  few others but those are what I'm best at .
Currently not employed as developer but in a another creative position (musician).
Though Employed would be an overstatement for the musician .
I also do side computer repair work.
Now, I hate to sound like one of those "I'm just in it for the money" people, but let's face it music doesn't pay (very well) nor does computer repair work in  a town with under 3500 people and well software / web development pays much better.
But , I do enjoy the creativity and problem solving being a musician leads to.
I'm motivated and hardworking and I hope to land a position as either a web developer or java developer when I can be creative and solve problems on daily basis with much better pay than I'm currently making.
I'm VERY willing to travel for the best opportunities.
